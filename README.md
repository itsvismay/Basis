# Basis

Todo list:

0. Get the simulation to work with fixed points
      - Create P matrix (done)
      - Do dynamics based on the projection matrix (done)


1. Make sure the physics is right
     - Implicit time integrator
     - That weird optimization thing
     - Density seems off. hMesh[0] wiggles more than hMesh[2]

3. Test everything for linear modes
    - Free fall sim
    - Fixed points sim

4. Run the full Youngs solver
    - Run on test, make sure it works
    - Run on a modal basis

5. Time warp
    - Talk to Dave

6. Make the optimizer better
